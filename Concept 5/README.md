# Concept 5

Example, the program makes sure that the variable will not be overloaded from input and will adjust the variable type according to user input.

Nonexample, the program will allow variables to be overloaded, leaving data miscalculated. Bad for modulation and plug in place variables.

The couch is a number, if it is too large it will not fit in all variable types or a car. Variables work the same way, you can change varibale types when data gets to large to a different variable type, leaving the program modular.
