The goal of this assignment is to encapsulate the 10 fundamental concepts of Cybersecurity by providing both example and non-example c/c++ code, as well as a picture and written explanation for each concept.

The 10 fundamental concepts are as follows: **Domain Separation, Process Isolation, Resource Encapsulation, Least Privilege, Modularity, Layering, Abstraction, Data Hiding, Simplicity and Minimization**.

For the first part of this assignment, we will be covering: Domain Separtion,

Each concept will have its own subdirectory, unless multiple concepts are being covered using a single example _(which we were told in class we were allowed to do)_.
