The goal of this assignment is to encapsulate the 10 fundamental concepts of Cybersecurity by providing both example and non-example C/C++ code, as well as a picture and written explanation for each concept.

The 10 fundamental concepts are as follows: **Domain Separation, Process Isolation, Resource Encapsulation, Least Privilege, Modularity, Layering, Abstraction, Data Hiding, Simplicity and Minimization**.

For the first part of this assignment, we will be covering: Domain Separation, Resource Encapsulation, Modularity, Abstraction, Data Hiding and Simplicity.

In the next part of the assignment, we will cover the reamining concepts in the same fashion (i.e. Process Isolation, Least Privilege, Layering and Minimization).

Each concept will have its own subdirectory, unless multiple concepts are being covered using a single example _(which we were told in class we were allowed to do)_.

**NOTE:** _Makefile is unix based. I can at least guarentee it worked on my virtual ubuntu machine._
