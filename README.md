The goal of this assignment is to encapsulate the 10 fundamental concepts of Cybersecurity by providing both example and non-example C/C++ code, as well as a picture and written explanation for each concept.

The 10 fundamental concepts are as follows: **Domain Separation, Process Isolation, Resource Encapsulation, Least Privilege, Modularity, Layering, Abstraction, Data Hiding, Simplicity and Minimization**.

The following are brief summaries for each concept:

* Domain Separation - Keep resources belonging to separate sections separate from one another.
* Process Isolation - Only allow one process to have access to a resource at a given time.
* Resource Encapsulation - Encapsulate any resources (data and functions) in a self contained object.
* Least Privilege - Only give a user the minimum number of privileges they need to accomplish any given task.
* Modularity - Separating a project into multiple working parts which do only one task and do it very well, such that they can be combined to create the larger overall project.
* Layering - Create multiple layers to a project by creating tasks that the user must complete before moving onto the next task.
* Abstraction - Use objects to represent concepts as to remove unnecessary clutter.
* Data Hiding - Keeping aspects of an object private so that they cannot be observed or accessed outside of the object.
* Simplicity - Removing any unnecessary clutter from code.
* Minimization - Reduce the chance of an exploitation by removing any unnecessary resources.

For the first part of this assignment, we covered: Domain Separation, Resource Encapsulation, Modularity, Abstraction, Data Hiding and Simplicity.

In the second part of the assignment, we covered the reamining concepts (i.e. Process Isolation, Least Privilege, Layering (x2) and Minimization).

The concept of layering was covered twice, as both of the examples that we made include layering through a required password.

Each concept has its own subdirectory, unless multiple concepts are being covered using a single example _(which we were told in class we were allowed to do)_.

**NOTE:** _Makefile is unix based. I can at least guarentee it worked on my virtual ubuntu machine._
